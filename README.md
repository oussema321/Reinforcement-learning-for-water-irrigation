Water is a major contributing factor for plant growth and development.
Agricultural water management is a major concern for agriculturists, as fresh water
resources are being depleted and research in the area of water optimization for agricultural
irrigation is in its initial stages. The main goal of the agricultural systems is to supply
water spatially according to the soil/land conditions such as water holding capacity of the
soil, texture, drainage, texture and topography. While currently existing irrigation systems
provide constant irrigation throughout the field, this may result in over irrigation in some
areas and under irrigation in the other areas. The main goal of my research is to minimize
the excess application of water in a specific location according to the daily conditions like
temperature, solar radiation, rainfall from weather data website and soil water content
reported by the sensors.
The precision techniques that are presently being used are solely based on sensor
data obtained from different sources and leverage supervised learning technique i.e. the
system is provided with the solutions to all different environments initially. The main
disadvantage of this approach is that, the actual scenario might differ widely from the
programmed/provided cases. So the system needs to adapt for variable weather, soil and
plant conditions and learn from the past experience as well as try new methods. In this
thesis a novel technique to use reinforcement learning (an adaptive learning system) on
crop system models to make the irrigation system adaptive is discussed
